              The audio sample is taken from the output of a rhythm generator implemented 
              in C++. This is a work in progress, as the interface is in the design phase. 
              Much of the impetus for this project stems from the fact that existing 
              open-source audio libraries, or those I've come across at least, do not 
              mix percussive audio samples with high-fidelity. When audio samples are mixed, 
              there is a risk that the sum of the bytes of each audio stream is greater than 
              the maximum size of the byte itself. This is called clipping. 
              Thus, samples must be scaled in a process called dynamic range compression 
              (DRC) to keep audio within the range of the highest and lowest byte values.
              The DRC algorithm implemented here relies on a very low-base logarithmic 
              scaling which dampens the amplitude of the buffer if it reaches above or below
              a certain precent of the byte extrema. 
            </p>

              An interesting history note: Since the advent of digital technology, 
              DRC has become more prominent in popular music releases. 
              The average volume has been increased without overfilling the 
              audio byte stream, which has had the effect of minimizing the difference 
              in 'quiet' and 'loud' sections of songs. In effect, volume dynamics 
              have been sacrifice in favor of sheer loudness since the 1990s. 
              This occurence has been referred to in music journalism as 'The Loudness War.'
