            A clone of the arcade game Asteroids, implemented in Java

            <p>
              This is a project from my early days of programming. 
              It's a relatively crude version of Asteroids implemented 
              in Java using the standard graphics and audio libraries. 
              The controls are choppy, the animation not smooth. 
              It was implemented over the course of a 4 day weekend 
              as a exercise of amateur speed-coding.
