              The website broncocorner.com was implemented with the MEAN stack,
              which includes node.js, Express, AngularJS, and MongoDB. 
              It allows for registering with a Cal Poly Pomona email account.
              There is a posting system, to which users can respond. 
              The database of posts can be searched for convenience. 
              Once a transaction is completed, a user can 
              delete the post of interest. 
              The router occurs predominantly in the frontend 
              using the AngularJS router functiionality.
