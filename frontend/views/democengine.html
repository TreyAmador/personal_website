    <div class="cengine-description">
      This engine was implemented in C++ using 
      the Simple DirectMedia Library for the 
      purpose of rendering graphics. It includes 
      a physics engine, a particle engine, 
      an automatic map-loader which parses xml files, 
      graphics managers, etc...
      The design paradigm centered around all in-game 
      objects inhereting from abstract geometic objects 
      which roughly represented their physical properties,
      (i.e., circular sprites inheret from circle class). 
      All physics calculations were greatly simplified 
      since each update referred to the superclass, 
      and not the object itself. 
      In turn, each physics shape 
      inhereted from a 'body' class. 
      This had the advantage of allowing all objects 
      to be updated and rendered by simply passing 
      the body superclass into functions which 
      completed these tasks, rather than updating 
      each sprite individually.  One could pass 
      any 'body' object into the camera object,
      for example, which would calculate the offset 
      and render it to screen.
